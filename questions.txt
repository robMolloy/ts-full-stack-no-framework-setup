1. What is your favourite programming language and why?
TypeScript because I don't like bugs ;)

2. Which cloud service provider is your favourite and why?
Firestore for small projects, probably Mongo for bigger projects

3. What is your preferred approach to testing software?
Behaviour driven carried out by specialist testers and test driven development by developers. One caveat that I like to preach to my developers is that bad tests give false confidence which is worse than no confidence.

4. Please provide your views and any relevant experience you have with devops, including web and mobile CI/CD:
I am terrible with workflows. Workflows work best (IMO) when they make FE/BE developer's lives easier. Nothing should be more difficult than clicking a button (maybe two), github secrets (or similar) should be kept to a minimum. Workflows should run in a reasonable (up for dicussion) amount of time and fail even quicker if they are going to fail at all. I could talk at length about what my current company do well and badly.

5. What are the three most important things to you about your next project or role you undertake?
Delivering value 
Code quality
Work/life balance
